Spoken language identification in the [emOSA open speech
archive](http://hlt.bme.hu/en/projects/speech) that is part of the
[e-magyar](http://e-magyar.hu/) Hungarian Language Technology pipeline. 

## Languages in the archive

The primary focus of emOSA is Hungarian and the minority languages in Hungary
(eg. Lovári, Beas, etc), but we support national and minority languages and
dialects in the neighboring countries. Our primary source is research conducted
among the diaspora in Hungary, Romania (Transylvania, Bucharest), Slovakia
(Upper), Ukraine (Transcarpathia), Serbia (Vojvodina), Slovenia, Austria
(Burgenland) and the US (USA, etc.), and material from these countries that is
openly available for download and not copyrighted. In order to respect
copyright, we avoid music material (except songs recorded in the study
population), and only audio content is stored. Apart from Hungarian, the system
currently contains material in the following languages: Romanian, Gypsy, Beas,
Slovak, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, Ukrainian, German, English, and Spanish.

## Configuration files and protocol directories

Configuration files and protocol directories for language recognition

This software has been created following the instructions in [this mail

## In progress

Models (wav-to-iVector, iVector-based classifiers) and wrapper scripts will be
